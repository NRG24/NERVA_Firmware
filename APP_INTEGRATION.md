# App integration guide

Everything a phone app needs to talk to the ring. Firmware as of v0.3
(2026-09-11).

---

## 1. Discovery

The ring advertises as a connectable peripheral:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Device name | `Ring PPG` (`CONFIG_BT_DEVICE_NAME`) |
| Advertised service UUIDs | `0x180D` (Heart Rate), `0x180F` (Battery) |
| Appearance | 833 |
| Advertising interval | `BT_LE_ADV_CONN_FAST_1` (~30 ms, fast connect) |

Scan-filtering on `0x180D` is enough to find it. The name lives in the
scan response, not the advertising packet, so filter on the service UUID
rather than the name if you want a reliable match.

Advertising runs continuously, including while charging.

---

## 2. Services

Two standard services plus one custom.

### Heart Rate Service — `0x180D`

Standard. Any generic HR app will work with no special support. The ring
notifies the Heart Rate Measurement characteristic (`0x2A37`) once per
second **while a valid reading exists**. Format is the SIG standard: flags
byte then an 8-bit BPM.

Notifications stop when no finger is present. **Absence of a notification
means "no reading", not "zero BPM".**

### Battery Service — `0x180F`

Standard, 0-100 percent, updated every 30 s.

> **Treat this number with suspicion.** It is a plain linear map of
> 3.30-4.20 V, not a state of charge. A LiPo discharge curve is strongly
> non-linear and terminal voltage sags under load, so this reads badly
> wrong in the middle of the range. Use `battery_mv` from the Ring Service
> status packet and apply your own curve if you need accuracy. See
> section 6.

### Ring Service — `f0a10000-1e5c-4a2b-8d3f-9c7b6e5a4d21`

Everything the standard services cannot express.

| Characteristic | UUID | Properties |
|---|---|---|
| Status | `f0a10001-1e5c-4a2b-8d3f-9c7b6e5a4d21` | Read, Notify |
| PPG stream | `f0a10002-1e5c-4a2b-8d3f-9c7b6e5a4d21` | Notify |
| IMU stream | `f0a10003-1e5c-4a2b-8d3f-9c7b6e5a4d21` | Notify |
| Control | `f0a10004-1e5c-4a2b-8d3f-9c7b6e5a4d21` | Write, Write w/o response |

---

## 3. Status characteristic

20 bytes, **little-endian**, sized to fit a default 23-byte ATT MTU so it
never fragments. Readable at any time; notified once per second while
measuring and on every state change.

| Offset | Type | Field | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | u8 | `state` | 0 idle, 1 measuring, 2 charging |
| 1 | u8 | `flags` | see below |
| 2 | u16 | `hr_x10` | BPM x10. **0 means no valid reading** |
| 4 | u16 | `battery_mv` | millivolts, the trustworthy battery number |
| 6 | i16 | `gsr_mv` | millivolts, **-1 = not measured** |
| 8 | u32 | `ppg_dc` | PPG DC level, the wear-detection signal |
| 12 | u16 | `ppg_ac` | PPG AC amplitude |
| 14 | u16 | `perfusion_x10` | perfusion index in tenths of a percent |
| 16 | u32 | `uptime_s` | seconds since boot |

`flags` bits:

| Bit | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | finger present (`ppg_dc` above the wear threshold) |
| 1 | charger attached |
| 2 | PPG sensor responding |
| 3 | IMU responding |
| 4 | PMIC responding |

Bits 2-4 are **live**, not latched at boot. Each one tracks whether that
subsystem is answering right now:

| Bit | Cleared when |
|---|---|
| 2 PPG | five consecutive FIFO reads fail, or a re-probe finds nothing |
| 3 IMU | an accelerometer read fails while idle |
| 4 PMIC | a PMIC transaction fails |

Each is set again as soon as the device answers, so a bit that flickers is
reporting a real intermittent fault — a cold joint or a marginal bus — not
noise in the firmware. Surface them in a diagnostics screen rather than
silently showing zeros.

> This changed in v0.3. These bits used to be set once at boot and never
> re-evaluated, so a device that died mid-session still reported healthy.
> `RING_FLAG_PMIC_OK` was worse than latched: it was set unconditionally
> every poll, including when the PMIC could not be reached at all. If your
> app assumed "set once at boot", it needs no change to keep working, but it
> can now trust these to mean something.

### Signal quality

`perfusion_x10` is your signal-quality indicator, and it behaves
counter-intuitively:

| Condition | `ppg_dc` | `perfusion_x10` |
|---|---|---|
| Nothing on the sensor | ~2,800 | ~40 (meaningless, it is noise) |
| Finger, good pressure | ~53,000 | ~30 |
| Finger, pressed too hard | ~79,000 | ~10 |

Use `ppg_dc` to decide whether anything is on the sensor — it moves by a
factor of nineteen and is unambiguous. Use `perfusion_x10` **only once
`ppg_dc` says a finger is present**, where a falling PI means the user is
pressing too hard and occluding their own capillaries. "Loosen your grip"
is a genuinely useful prompt at `ppg_dc > 70000` with `perfusion_x10 < 15`.

---

## 4. PPG stream

Raw samples, off by default because it is expensive. Enable with control
opcode `0x01`.

```
offset 0   u32  seq          increments per notification, gaps = dropped packets
offset 4   u8   count        number of samples that follow
offset 5   u32[count]        19-bit ADC values, zero-extended
```

Sample rate is **100 Hz**. Packet size adapts to the negotiated MTU:

| MTU | Samples per notification |
|---|---|
| 23 (default) | 4 |
| 247 (requested) | up to 40 |

**Request a 247-byte MTU.** At the default you get ~25 notifications per
second, which most phones will struggle to sustain and which will drop
packets. Watch `seq` for gaps.

Enabling the PPG stream forces the ring into a measurement window and
**keeps it there** — normal duty cycling is suspended for as long as you
are streaming. Turn it off when you are done or the battery will suffer.

---

## 5. IMU stream

Off by default. Enable with control opcode `0x02`.

```
offset 0   i16  x
offset 2   i16  y
offset 4   i16  z
```

Raw counts at +/-2 g full scale, so **milli-g = raw * 2000 / 32768**.
Sampled at the main loop rate, roughly 50 Hz while measuring and 50 Hz
while idle with streaming on.

---

## 6. Control characteristic

Write (with or without response). First byte is the opcode.

| Opcode | Payload | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `0x01` | `u8 on` | Raw PPG streaming on/off. Turning it on forces a measurement window. |
| `0x02` | `u8 on` | IMU streaming on/off |
| `0x03` | none | Start a measurement window immediately, skipping the duty cycle |
| `0x04` | `u16 window_s`, `u16 period_s` | Set duty cycle, little-endian |

Duty cycle values are clamped in firmware: window 5-300 s, period
window-3600 s. Defaults are a **15 s window every 60 s**, i.e. 25% duty.

Both streams are forced off on disconnect, so a phone that walks away
cannot leave the ring burning battery.

Example — request a reading right now:

```
write [0x03]
```

Example — 10 s window every 5 minutes:

```
write [0x04, 0x0A, 0x00, 0x2C, 0x01]
              window=10        period=300
```

## 7. Behaviour your app has to expect

**The ring is not always measuring.** By default the optical front end is
off for 45 seconds out of every 60, and completely off when the ring has
been still for 3 minutes. That is deliberate — the LEDs plus the 5 V boost
dominate power draw.

Consequences:

* HR notifications arrive in bursts, not continuously. Gaps of a minute
  are normal, not a fault.
* If the user opens your app and wants a reading *now*, send opcode
  `0x03`. Do not wait for the next scheduled window.
* After a window starts it takes roughly **4 seconds to settle** and
  another **8 beats** before a BPM appears. Budget 10-15 s from request to
  first reading, and show a progress state rather than a spinner that
  looks stuck.

**Wake on motion.** The ring sleeps until the IMU sees roughly 80 mg of
movement, then immediately opens a window to look for a finger. Picking the
ring up wakes it; it does not need the app to poke it.

**Charging suspends measurement entirely.** In `state == 2` there is no PPG
data at all, the LEDs are off, and HR notifications stop. Show a charging
state, not "no signal". The red LED lights for 3 seconds when a charger is
first detected, so the user gets confirmation without opening the app.

## 8. Connection parameters

The firmware does not request specific connection parameters, so you get
whatever the phone proposes. Recommendations:

| Use case | Interval | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Background HR only | 200-500 ms | Cheapest; HR only updates once a second anyway |
| Raw PPG streaming | 15-30 ms | Needed to keep up with 100 Hz sampling |

Also request a **247-byte MTU** before enabling any stream, and a data
length extension if your stack exposes it.

---

## 9. Caveats worth knowing

These are real limitations of the current hardware and firmware, not
things to paper over in the UI.

**Heart rate is not validated.** The algorithm is a DC tracker, a 4 Hz
low-pass, adaptive-threshold peak detection, and a median of the last 8
intervals. It has been sanity-checked against plausible resting rates only
— never against a reference monitor. Do not present it as medical-grade,
and do not build clinical features on it until it has been validated.

**Battery percentage is a voltage bar.** See section 2. `battery_mv` is a
real measurement from the PMIC with roughly +/-42 mV resolution. The
percentage is not a state of charge.

**GSR is unproven.** The analog front end has never been tested with
anything across the electrodes. `gsr_mv` will report a number; nobody has
confirmed it means anything. Treat it as experimental.

**Battery temperature protection is disabled.** The PMIC's TS pin is
unconnected on this board revision, so the firmware disables the thermal
monitor to allow charging at all. This is a bench workaround, not a
shippable configuration. See `HARDWARE_NOTES.md` item 9.

**No bonding or encryption.** `CONFIG_BT_SMP` is enabled but nothing
requires authentication, and no characteristic demands an encrypted link.
Anyone in range can connect and read biometric data. **This must be fixed
before shipping** — at minimum require encryption on the Ring Service
characteristics and implement pairing.

## 10. Quick start

1. Scan for service `0x180D`, connect
2. Request MTU 247
3. Subscribe to Status (`f0a10001-...`)
4. Subscribe to Heart Rate Measurement (`0x2A37`)
5. Write `[0x03]` to Control to request an immediate reading
6. Watch `flags` bit 0 for finger presence and `perfusion_x10` for grip
   quality; show the user a "hold still, don't squeeze" prompt while
   `hr_x10` is still 0
7. Read `battery_mv` from Status, not the Battery Service percentage
